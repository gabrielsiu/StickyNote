Sometimes you need to take a note as quickly as possible, or write down a reminder without risk of forgetting about it. StickyNote is a tweak that provides a solution to these situations, by adding a handy sticky note to your device's lock screen / Cover Sheet.

## Features
* Immediate access
	* StickyNote lives on your device's lock screen / Cover Sheet, which means that it's the first thing you see when you unlock your device, and is always a swipe away when your device is unlocked
* Visible when you need it, gone when you don't
	* Hide the sticky note using the show/hide button to view your notifications without distraction
* Customization
	* Almost all of the aspects of the sticky note are customizable, including colors, fonts, sizing, animations, and more
* Security
	* Optional feature to hide the contents of the sticky note until you unlock your device; compatible with both Face ID and Touch ID
* Free and open source
